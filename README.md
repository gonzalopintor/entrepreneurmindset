# My Website

My name is Gonzalo Pintor Novo. I am doing this project for Fundamentals of Computer Engineering subject. 
Welcome to my website! This repository contains the source code for my personal website with a topic I am talking about.

## Contents


### Description

The web contains personal information about my self and what I am studing. It is a project for FCE subject in which we have to create a web with different web pages in a structured way as I show below and in which everything must be linked in a correct way for its operation. Then we have to introduce it in a github repository with the commands to clone it. In this repository we will also find this readme file and a license. When we change the branches to put as main the docs folder, we will obtain a link that we will send to the teacher to be able to access our web page remotely. With this project we introduce ourselves in a slight way in the HTML language for the web development. It is a very useful tool to learn since we could dedicate ourselves to the development of web in our professional career. 


### Project Structure

The website contains a principal index page with several linked pages that can be browsed for different information. Among them we find an about me, a topic page, a net to connect with other colleagues' websites, a dergee page where I talk about the double degree I am studying and it takes me to a page where I talk about the Fundamentals of Computer Engineering subject. Finally there is a contact page where the user must enter some information along with a message you want to convey or something you want to ask me. Everything needs to be inside a docs folder in which there we must have other folders like css for the styles or images for th photos in the web pages. Inside every page we need to link the css styles. We had also to introduce a Readme file and a license for the github repository.
* `index.html`: Main / Home page.
* `about.html`: "About Me" page.
* `topic.html`: "Entrepreneur mindset" page.
* `net.html`: "Connections" page.
* `contact.html`: "Contact" page.
* `degree.html`: "Business Analytics + Computer Engineering" page.
* `fundamentals.html`: FCE subjetc.
* `styles.css`: CSS file for additional styles.
* Other files and folders as needed as images or fonts ones.



### Customization

For the customization of the web pages or the web app we used a css file. There we can have all the styles we need to create a estetic web wit consistency in their colours and fonts. I used a template for it and modified for making it a bit personal. With a combination of Yellow, Grey, Black and White colours. I also introduced a lot of images and icons to make it more visual, simple and clear for the user. We used big coloured titles and texts to make it easier for the reader to understand and follow the information with no dificulty.

### Problems
1. **Issue 1**: Defining a unique css document for every style for the web.
   - **Solution**: I unified every style from all files to the same one, and make it easier to me to link the css to every page.

2. **Issue 2**: I neede to structure well all pages and link them because it did not worked.
   - **Solution**: I made a good structure inside the docs folder and then into the code I linked by their paths to make ir work.


### Contributions

I have learned and used information from many other webs and blogs about my topic or the degree. Also from de UFV site which I linked to in the degree page. We are also open to receive any help or reccomendation for improving the web, our clients are first.
